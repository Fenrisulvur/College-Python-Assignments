Assignment:
    Create a program that asks a user how many rows there should be in the tower. Based on the userâ€™s value (1-8), draw that many rows on the canvas in a pyramid style. 
    Each row should be row_height pixels tall and the top row should be individual_block_width pixels wide. 
    Each row should be individual_block_width pixels larger than the one above it. 
    Each row should be centered around the vertical axis and the bottom row should be situated on the bottom on the canvas.
